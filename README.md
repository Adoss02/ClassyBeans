What is Classy Beans?

Classy Beans is a faction war based Modpack built for the Classy Beans server.
We wanted to release our Modpack out into the open for all to see and experience.
 

What does it contain?

We build our Modpack to contain a wide variety of mods. (too many to cover here)
However in a general view, it is PVP/PVE focused with multiple choices to destroy anything in your path.
Multiple vehicles, aircraft, and weapons for any situation.


How can I join?

Unfortunately, as of right now there is no public Classy Beans server.
This may change in the future.
